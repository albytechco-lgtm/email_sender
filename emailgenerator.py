Write a cold email in the EXACT SMYKM style from the example. This is for a remodeling/construction company in Houston.

COMPANY INFO:
- Name: {name}
- Email: {email}
- About: {about}
- Specialty: {specialty}
- Website: {website}

REQUIRED EMAIL STRUCTURE (follow this exactly):

1. SUBJECT LINE: "{subject_line}"

2. EMAIL BODY:
   - Casual opener: "Hi [Name]," followed by a non-salesy first sentence (like "We haven't met yet, but I'm [Your name]...")
   - Houston connection: Naturally mention something about Houston remodeling/construction scene
   - Transition question: Ask something quirky related to "{houston_ref}" (like the "closest Pilot/Flying J" style question)
   - Challenge: Identify their specific pain point (invoice processing from suppliers, managing project billing, tracking payments across multiple jobs)
   - Value proposition: Explain email-to-Google Sheets automation benefits for remodeling companies
   - Social proof: Reference other remodeling/construction companies who benefit from this
   - Casual close: Friendly request for a chat
   - Sign off with "Cheers!" and your name
   - P.S.: Answer to the quirky question

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Sound like you actually know the remodeling industry in Houston
- Reference specific pain points remodeling companies face:
  * Managing invoices from multiple suppliers (lumber, tile, fixtures, etc.)
  * Tracking costs across different job sites  
  * Dealing with change orders and additional materials
  * Organizing receipts for client billing
  * Managing subcontractor invoices

- Tone: Conversational, slightly quirky, professional but not corporate
- Include Houston-specific knowledge naturally
- Make it feel researched and personal to their business

- Your service: Automatically converts invoices from emails into organized Google Sheets for easy tracking and billing

OUTPUT FORMAT:
SUBJECT: [subject line]

BODY:
